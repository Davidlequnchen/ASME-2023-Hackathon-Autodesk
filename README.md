# ASME IDETC 2023 Hackathon - Autodesk Problems

## Overview

This repository contains the first-place solution to the Autodesk problems at the ASME IDETC 2023 Hackathon. The aim of the project was to come up with an open-ended solution to identify an appropriate material for a set of parts, based on their CAD geometries and assembly context.
